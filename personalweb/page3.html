            What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
            The website would be able to help them answer questions such as what 
            event/activities are happening around me, where are they going to take place?,
             and how can I get the tickets if applicable. </p>
    
             <p> What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
            The activities the visitors on the website would want to complete is entering
             their location so they can locate events around them and getting the address
              & ticket information for the event. </p>
